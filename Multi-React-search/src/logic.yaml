Changes Needed:
Track Highlighted Index: Add a highlightIndex state to track the currently focused suggestion.

Handle Keyboard Navigation: Modify the onKeyDown handler to update the highlightIndex when the ArrowUp or ArrowDown keys are pressed and handle selection with the Enter key.

Dynamic Highlighting: Use conditional CSS classes to visually indicate which suggestion is highlighted.
